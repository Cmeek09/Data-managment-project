# Data managament project

This project brings in bike rental data, cleans it, places it in a Postgres database.  finally will have some data viz to see the information from tableau.

## Database

After looking at the data and cleaning it up there is some anomolies in the data that still make me concerned.  I think the views I make will isolate that so they can be looked at.  Most likely theres are errors, since this is supposed to be bike data from a city government.
